## Summer Holiday's 2026##
<br>
Here is the Holidays [I AM COMING](https://forms.gle/wKmw33jqrARpBHzC9) form.<br> 
Each day is $55 and lunch is included. If you can't afford it, grab a sponsored slot (just ask).
<br><br>

<p align="left"><b>CONTENT CREATORS LAB</b></p>
DATES TO BE CONFIRMED - It will be a Wednesday and Thursday - 8:30am to 5pm Age 12+<br>
These two days are about the process of creating content - developing ideas, filming, editing and posting. We will look at the good, the bad and the ugly and consider how to get the views. At the end of Day 2 you will have created and uploaded video content to your own Channel. If you're after fame and fortune then you're probably doomed. But come along! Learn and have fun with friends anyway.<br><br>

<p align="left"><b>MINECRAFT GAME DAY</b></p>
DATE TO BE CONFIRMED - It will be a Wednesday - 8:30am to 5pm  Age 9+<br> 
I think the name says it all - this day will be a full on Minecraft game day. This day will be run by our teens with Kevin as the fireman. It will be an epic supersaturated day that will leave the participants dreaming of blocks and building and mobs and diamonds and...<br><br>   

<p align="left"><b>3D DESIGN LAB</b></p>
DATE TO BE CONFIRMED - It will be a Friday - 8:30am to 5pm<br> 
This is a day for MAKING from scratch. You will design and 3D print a Rubber Band Gun. Yes that is the most useful thing you could possibly have in your school bag.
To do this you will learn TinkerCad (not too hard to learn) or else OnShape (which is a bit harder but much better). Being comfortable drawing something that you need, and then printing it out, is a super power. An essential skill for makers and creators of all types - engineers, designers, mad scientists and artists.   <br><br>

<p align="left"><b>SERIOUS Day in the Lab</b></p>
DATE TO BE CONFIRMED - It will be a couple of Fridays - 8:30am to 5pm<br> 
This is much like the Projects Group - it is a day for independently working on projects - whatever that is for you. A Social, create, make and break day. People will be coding, playing games, working on robotics and electronics, and generally reinventing the world. Do your thing. <br><br>
