**Here is the Holidays [I AM COMING](https://forms.gle/wKmw33jqrARpBHzC9) form.**<br>

<p align="left"><b>CONTENT CREATORS LAB</b></p>
Wednesday 2nd and Thursday 3rd  - 8:30am to 5pm Age 12+<br>
These two days are about the process of creating content - developing ideas, filming, editing and posting. We will look at the good, the bad and the ugly and consider how to get the views. At the end of Day 2 you will have created and uploaded video content to your own Channel. If you're after fame and fortune then you're probably doomed. But come along! Learn and have fun with friends anyway.<br><br>

<p align="left"><b>MINECRAFT GAME DAY</b></p>
Wednesday 9th - 8:30am to 5pm  Age 9+<br> 
I think the name says it all - this day will be a full on Minecraft game day. This day will be run by our teens with Kevin as the fireman. It will be an epic supersaturated day that will leave the participants dreaming of blocks and building and mobs and diamonds and...<br><br>   

<p align="left"><b>3D DESIGN LAB</b></p>
Friday 11th - 8:30am to 5pm<br> 
This is a day for MAKING from scratch. You will design and 3D print a Rubber Band Gun. Yes that is the most useful thing you could possibly have in your school bag.
To do this you will learn TinkerCad (not too hard to learn) or else OnShape (which is a bit harder but much better). Being comfortable drawing something that you need, and then printing it out, is a super power. An essential skill for makers and creators of all types - engineers, designers, mad scientists and artists.   <br><br>
