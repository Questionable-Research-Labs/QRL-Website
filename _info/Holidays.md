<p align="left"><b>Not Serious Day</b></p>
Wednesday 2nd - 8:30am to 5pm<br>
This is a social day. Hang out and play games with friends. The lab is our creative playground. Serious things might happen but that will be accidental. Lunch provided. Plenty of fruit and water available. <br><br>

<p align="left"><b>Serious Day 1 AND ALSO Dungeons & Dragons Game Day</b></p>
Friday 4th - 8:30am to 5pm<br> 
Serious Day 1: This day is for any of our experienced members who are working on projects or tutorials or generally able to do their own thing whatever that is, in our social environment. Film work, electronics, coding, general making, designing, creating or... even school work. It doesn't really matter what you want to do, but independently doing your thing (with friends) is what the serious days are about.<br><br>
Dungeons and Dragons Game Day:  This is for those 12+ who want to have a day living in a different universe with friends. We might need to limit spaces depending on who is able to dungeon master.<br><br>   

<p align="left"><b>Serious Day 2</b></p>
Wednesday 9th - 8:30am to 5pm<br> 
Serious Day 2 is another day like the first one. It is for our experienced members who are working on projects or tutorials or generally able to do their own thing whatever that is<br><br> 

<p align="left"><b>MINECRAFT GAME DAY</b></p>
Friday 11th - 8:30am to 5pm<br> 
I think the name says it all - this day will be a full on Minecraft game day. This day will be run by our teens Noah, Tainui and Seven (plus helpers) with Kevin as the fireman. It will be an epic supersaturated day that will leave the participants dreaming of blocks and building and mobs and diamonds and...<br> 
Warning: Limited places.  <br><br>
