#### Questionable Research Labs runs on a **Patronage model**.

## General Principles

*   We will NEVER let money be a barrier to your participation.<br>
*   Familys support us by becoming PATRONS.<br>
*   Patrons are also other people in the community who value what we do<br>
*   Holiday Events a set price - but if cost is a barrier there are sponsors, just ask.<br>

## Membership
To be a Member of Questionable Research Labs and attend our groups you need to sign-up. **[Here is the Membership Form](https://forms.gle/f3QPNox6pE8DRQZBA)**.
Next you need to put your name down on the waiting list for the group(s) you would like to come to. We will let you know when we can fit you in. See the [Groups Page](https://questionable.org.nz/notices/groups/) for the links to the "I would like to come" forms. 

One off events, workshops and general holiday activities will have a separate sign-up form. To attend these you should always use those forms so we know you are coming. 

## Patrons
Please become a patron to support what we do. Patrons set up a regular, repeating deposit via online banking. We suggest $15 per week. Smaller amounts are most welcome and naturally larger amounts are VERY appreciated. Being a patron is about supporting the development of a clever, creative, entrepreneurial culture in Northland. It is all about growing amazing interesting humans.
Here is the account number: `38-9023-0603067-00`
The account name is: Questionable Research Labs Trust
And use your membership number in the reference.

We are a registered charity and at the years end we will provide a donation receipt for claiming back a third of you donation. This means $15/week only really costs you $10. An unbelivable bargin. 

## Sponsorship
For organizations wanting to support our activity in a way that is compatible with growing their business please talk to us. We can provide excellent promotional opportunities and we are always looking for resources and services as well as funding.
For individuals looking to provide targeted support, we are very happy to work with you on those goals.

## Other ways to contribute
Extra People Power to run our space is always welcome. From help with cleaning-up right through to help with teaching a group. Come and have a chat.
