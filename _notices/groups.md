## IMPORTANT - We will not be running groups this team (Term 3) 
Sorry to say but we need to move out of our existing building (within Tikipunga High School) as the building is going to be repurposed as temporary classrooms.
<br>We need to find another location, ideally a dedicated space close to the CBD for easier access, before we can continue.<br>
It is sad news.
